SOHO CTOF Data Analysis Suite

Made open source Jan. 2015.

This software was written by Lukas Saul during doctoral research on interstellar Helium pickup ions in the solar wind.  

It includes a GUI for enabling data filtering tasks and comparison tools for different time series data such as magnetic field, density, composition, and other sources.  It builds histograms and catalog plots of relevant SOHO data (see catalog files for examples).  
This data tool has been used in scientific analysis leading to several papers.  

Please acknowlege Lukas Saul and his thesis advisor Eberhard MÃ¶bius if you use this software.  

All contributions are welcome.
